# termlib

A minimalist terminal display librarey written in Go. I find myself wanting a little more than fmt provides for terminal output but don't want to reach for a rich Go terminal UI library like tcell. termlib explores that space.

## Release Notes

- version: 0.0.0
- status: concept
- released: 2025-11-19

A quick exploration of collecting the funcs I use for manipulating and display content in the terminal.
