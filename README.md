# termlib

A minimalist terminal display library written in Go. I often find myself wanting a little more than display control than fmt packages provides but don't want to commit to a rich library like tcell. This project, termlib, explores that space.

## Release Notes

- version: 0.0.2
- status: concept
- released: 2025-11-21

A quick exploration of collecting the funcs I use for manipulating and display content in the terminal.
